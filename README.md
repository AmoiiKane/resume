# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Mouad Ammi

Welcome â€” and thank you for taking the time to learn more about me.

I'm a software engineer with a deep curiosity for how things work and a strong passion for building them. From low-level systems in C to modern web apps in JavaScript and Solidity, my journey has been one of constant learning, hands-on creation, and problem solving.

Over the past few years, I've dedicated myself to mastering full-stack development â€” completing intensive training with **ALX Africa**, studying at **Pro-systems**, and applying that knowledge through real-world projects, code challenges, and team collaborations. Iâ€™ve developed a strong technical toolkit that includes **Git**, **Linux**, **Node.js**, **Oracle**, and more.

But beyond the tools and tech, I believe in **crafting solutions that matter**, collaborating openly, and never stopping the learning process. Whether Iâ€™m writing backend logic, refining frontend interfaces, or digging into database queries, my aim is to build with clarity, purpose, and clean code.

Fluent in English, French, and Arabic, and always excited to contribute, Iâ€™m currently open to opportunities where I can grow, innovate, and make meaningful impact.
